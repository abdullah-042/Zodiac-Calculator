Sagittarius, the ninth sign of the zodiac, is the home of the wanderers of the zodiac. Itâ€™s not a mindless ramble for these folks, either. Sags are truth-seekers, and the best way for them to do this is to hit the road, talk to others and get some answers. 
Knowledge is key to these folks since it fuels their broad-minded approach to life.Those born with a Sagittarius zodiac sign are keenly interested in philosophy and religion, and they find that these disciplines aid their internal quest.
