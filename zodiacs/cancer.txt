Cancer, the fourth sign of the zodiac, is all about home. Those born under this horoscope sign are ‘roots’ kinds of people, and take great pleasure in the comforts of home and family.
Cancers are maternal, domestic, and love to nurture others. More than likely, their family will be large, too—the more, the merrier! Cancers will certainly be merry if their home life is serene and harmonious.
